# MPI performance of a realistic vesicle model in STEPS.  

As described in:
Iain Hepburn, Jules Lallouette, Weiliang Chen, Andrew R. Gallimore, Sarah Y. Nagasawa-Soeda, Erik De Schutter: Vesicle and reaction-diffusion hybrid modeling with STEPS. Communications Biology (in press)

This data was collected by running the model of Gallimore et al (https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.08.03.551909) on the 'Deigo' cluster at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology, Okinawa, Japan. 

The data recorded to file performance.xlsx was run under the given commit to https://github.com/CNS-OIST/HBP_STEPS 

The plot performance.pdf can be generated by simply running 
 ```
 python3 performance_plot.py
 ```
Which produces file performance.pdf, as shown in Figure 9c in the manuscript.
