# Blender visualization validations

To run the Blender visualization validation tests:

```
python3 run_blender_test.py all
```

You can then manually check that the frames in `data/frames` were correctly rendered.

Some options are avaible to e.g. change which Blender version is used. To list options, use:
```
python3 run_blender_test.py --help
```
